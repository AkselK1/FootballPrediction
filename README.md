# Football Predictions
Authors: Tomi Lahe, Aksel Kaasik

Football is one of the most popular sports globally, captivating millions of fans with its unpredictability and thrilling outcomes. As passionate sports enthusiasts, we were inspired to explore whether we could predict various aspects of a football match, such as the result, goals scored, and other key features. By diving into historical match data, we aim to uncover patterns and factors that influence match outcomes beyond just team strength.

This project involves processing and analyzing European football match data to extract meaningful insights and create predictive models. Our goal is not only to understand the nuances of football better but also to leverage machine learning techniques to predict match results and performance metrics with accuracy. Success could provide valuable tools for fans, analysts while also offering a deeper appreciation for the complexities of the beautiful game.
